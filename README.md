# Climate Data Analysis - Europe

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of climate data for Europe from the years 1980 to 2019. The analysis aims to explore and visualize temperature trends and seasonal changes in the region. 

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis was sourced from [https://data.open-power-system-data.org/weather_data/]. It includes temperature records for various European countries over the specified time period.

## Analysis Highlights
- A comprehensive exploration of temperature changes in Europe over the years.
- Seasonal analysis to identify temperature variations for each season.
- Identification of countries with the most significant temperature increases.
- Interactive visualizations to dynamically explore the data.

## How to Use
To reproduce the analysis or view the visualizations, clone this repository and run the provided Jupyter Notebook. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed before executing the code.


**Note:** The CSV file containing the climate data is not included in this repository due to its large size. You will need to download the CSV file separately from [[https://data.open-power-system-data.org/weather_data/]] and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook before running the code.
